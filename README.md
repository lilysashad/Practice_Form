**The Art Contest Registration Form** is a practice form I made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript as my final project for my Coursera: Introduction to Web Development course.

Submitted by: **Lily Deng**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## You must create a form with 7 or more inputs of types you choose.  We have studied a variety of input types, such as text, radio, checkbox, etc.  You should decide a purpose for your form and design it to meet these requirements.  The form may have any purpose you like.  Examples include customer service form, food order form, product purchase, survey, contact form, etc.

* [x] Include a 3-5 sentence description of the form’s purpose.  Explain why you chose it and any details you care to mention.
* [x] Include working HTML, CSS, at least one image, and JavaScript validation. For the purposes of this assignment, you may use either an internal or external stylesheet, even though external is typically preferred. If you use an external stylesheet or any other external files, you must upload them all and name in your documentation (see below) all of the files used to make the project work.
* [x] Your form should have 7 or more inputs that represent at least 3 of the types we have studied.  Do not use the type submit button.
* [x] Inputs must have some sort of validation, including at least two JavaScript functions. Validation should occur on events such as onclick or onblur.
* [x] A minimum of 3 separate CSS classes or IDs are used in some way.
* [x] Use both HTML and JavaScript comments to document your work throughout your submission.

 ## Notes

The purpose of this form is to gather registration details of a prospective contestant in a fictitious art contest. Although there is a form that requires various inputs, the page also offers a quick form description under a gallery of images. The inputs require a particular format or validation, and therefore must all be filled out correctly in order for the contestant to submit.
